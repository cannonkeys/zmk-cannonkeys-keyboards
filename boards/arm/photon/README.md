The Photon is a wireless keyboard from ai03 Design Studio.  

The Photon has a top-side status LED. By default, it will indicate battery status and connection status.
It will also turn on when charging is active - this can be toggled off if desired.

The Photon also supports an optional encoder module, which is enabled by default in firmware.

ZMK Studio is supported on Photon.
